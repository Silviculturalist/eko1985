# Agent Guidelines

The overarching goal is to ensure parity between this package's Python implementation and the results produced by the supplied programme (Excel files). Parity must be maintained for the following aspects:

- Initialisation of stand values
- Growth
- Removals / deaths
- Thinnings
- End results
